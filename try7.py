sentence = "Neoliberalism as I and everyone else is talking about it started in the 1970s when people started to see that socialism wasn't working so well so they shifted back towards capitalism. \n\nWikipedia actually has a really good summary of it that covers your misunderstanding over the usage of the terminology. \n\n&gt;**Neoliberalism** or **neo-liberalism**[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-1) is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with [*laissez-faire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) [economic liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism) and [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Haymes-2):7[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-3) Those ideas include [economic liberalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalization) policies such as [privatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization), [austerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity), [deregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation), [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-4) and reductions in [government spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending) in order to increase the role of the [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector) in the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy) and [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society).[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-12) These market-based ideas and the policies they inspired constitute a [paradigm shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) away from the post-war [Keynesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) consensus which lasted from 1945 to 1980.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-FPIF-2004-13)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-14)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;English-speakers have used the term \"neoliberalism\" since the start of the 20th century with different meanings,[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-OxfordNeoliberalism-15) but it became more prevalent in its current meaning in the 1970s and 1980s, used by scholars in a wide variety of [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science)[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-16)[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Handbookscholarship-17) as well as by critics.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-18)[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Jones2014-19) Modern advocates of free market policies avoid the term \"neoliberal\"[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-20) and some scholars have described the term as meaning different things to different people[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-21)[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-22) as neoliberalism \"mutated\" into geopolitically distinct hybrids as it travelled around the world.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Handbook2-5) As such, neoliberalism shares many attributes with other concepts that have contested meanings, including [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy).[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-23)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The definition and usage of the term have changed over time.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Boas2009-6) As an [economic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_philosophy), neoliberalism emerged among European [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) scholars in the 1930s as they attempted to trace a so-called \"third\" or \"middle\" way between the conflicting philosophies of [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) and [socialist planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning).[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-mirowski-24):14\u201315 The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which neoliberals mostly blamed on the [economic policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy) of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term \"neoliberal\" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more *laissez-faire* doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the 1960s, usage of the term \"neoliberal\" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet)'s [economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Chile#%22Neoliberal%22_reforms_(1973%E2%80%9390)) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile), the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and *laissez-faire* capitalist set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of [Mont Pelerin Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society) economists [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek), [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman), and [James M. Buchanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Buchanan), along with politicians and policy-makers such as [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher), [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) and [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Boas2009-6)[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-25) Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Boas2009-6) By 1994, with the passage of [NAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA) and with the [Zapatistas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation)' reaction to this development in [Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas), the term entered global circulation.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Handbook2-5) Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-Handbookscholarship-17)[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#cite_note-26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
